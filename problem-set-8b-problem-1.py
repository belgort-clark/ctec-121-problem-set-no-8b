Most Frequent Letter in a Text String

Write a Python program that lets a person enter a string and displays the character that appears the most frequently in the string.

I have provided some starter code to help you get started.
'''


def mostFrequent():
    # initial variables
    count = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
             0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    index = 0
    frequent = 0

    user_string = input('Enter a string to be analyzed: ')

    # your code goes here


mostFrequent()
